# Localization contributions are welcome

> We currently only support EN but contributions are welcome and the extension will be updated with the provided language settings.

Check out all localizable strings in the [package.nls.json](../package.nls.json).
Please send a PR with your localized package.nls.<LOCALE>.json update
Use the package.nls.json file as a reference to localize the strings used in this extension
[How does localization work in vs-code](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-extension-samples/blob/main/l10n-sample/README.md)

Once the PR is merged, the extension will be updated with the localized strings in the upcoming releases
